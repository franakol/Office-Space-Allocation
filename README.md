# Office-Space-Allocation

This system is a utility that shows how rooms are allocated at Andela's office facility uin Kenya called the 'DOJO'

## Justification

When a new Staff joins Andela, they are assigned an office space only. When a new Fellow joins, they are assigned 
an office space and a living space that is optional if they choose to to take it. therefore this mimics a working 
model of how office and living space rooms are allocated.
